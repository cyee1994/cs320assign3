CS320 Assignment #3 README
 
This project consists of 3 different bash programs that are used to cheat through various means. 

The first script looks through a gradebook file and a login information file and finds the name of a student with 100s on all assignments and then finds their login credentials and password.

The second script looks through this student's repository and finds all c programs in their directories.

The third script compiles the c files and runs them in order to find out which file is what assignment.

prog3_1.sh is run using ./prog3_1.sh X Y with X being the grades file location and Y being the logins file location.

prog3_2.sh is run using ./prog3_2.sh X with X being the root directory of a repository with files that you are looking for. 

prog3_3.sh is run using ./prog3_2.sh A B C D with A B C and D being the four different C programs found from prog3_2.sh. The order they are entered into the command line do not matter.
